"""
You are free to customize the subtask titles. But to keep scalability, I do not recommend it
You are also free to modify the points.
Notice that there is no set limit on how many cases and subtasks there can be. You are free to add and remove subtasks and cases.
Wrap individual test cases around (), because tester.py will splat it
